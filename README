I created this AI to segment arteries for an internship, but I coded most of it on a work computer so I don't have access to most of it.
The "AIsegment.py" file is the code to train a new model, the "AI_use_file (5).py" file is the file to run the model, and the "AI_segmentation_unet_6_1267_frames_per.h5" file is a file for a model that I already trained.

The problem is I can't find any files (Ultrasound videos) to train or run the model on. All these files where on the work computer and now I don't have access to them.
